# Ruby Practice

Run your Ruby file by typing `ruby ` and then the name of the file you want to run in the Terminal.

If we want to run `each_even_word.rb`, we can write the command:

```bash
ruby each_even_word.rb
```

To re-run this command, you can use the UP and DOWN arrow keys to look at the history of commands you've run in a Terminal.

## Each

### each_spell_word.rb
Write a program that:

Asks your user to enter any word and have it spelled out letter by letter.  

Input
`Georgia`

Output
```bash
"G"
"E"
"O"
"R"
"G"
"I"
"A"
```

Example
```bash
"Enter a word for me to spell:"
Georgia
"G"
"E"
"O"
"R"
"G"
"I"
"A"
```

### each_even_word.rb
Write a program that:
  Asks the user to enter a list of words separated by spaces.
  The program should only print the words that are have an even number of characters

Example (`mountain pink vines` is the input)
```bash
"Enter a list of words separated by spaces:"
mountain pink vines
"mountain"
"pink"
```

### each_letter_count.rb

Write a program that:
 
 Asks the user to enter a word.
  The program should print each letter in the word the number of times it appears in the word.

Example input: `loop`

Output:
```bash
"Enter a word"
loop
l appears 1 times
o appears 2 times
o appears 2 times
p appears 1 times
```
